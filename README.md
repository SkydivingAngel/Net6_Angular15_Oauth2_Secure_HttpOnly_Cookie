# Net6_Angular15_Oauth2_Secure_HttpOnly_Cookie
**Net 6 and Angular 15 Project with Jwt saved in Secure and HttpOnly Cookie**

- **Progra.cs** is where the Cookie is checked for Authorization.
- **LoginController** is where the Cookie is created after Login. I omitted the validation.
- Still in LoginController thre is a method '**IsLoggedIn**' used to check if the user is Authorized.
